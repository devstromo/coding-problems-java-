# Longest Increasing Subsequence with k Replacements

## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence that can be formed by **replacing up to `k` elements** of the array with any values of your choice (not necessarily from the array).

You may perform at most `k` replacements. Your goal is to **maximize** the length of the resulting strictly increasing subsequence.

## Input

- An integer array `nums` of length `n` where `1 <= n <= 1000`
- An integer `k` where `0 <= k <= n`

## Output

- An integer representing the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence achievable by replacing up to `k` elements.

## Example

### Input
- `nums = [5, 3, 4, 2, 6]`
- `k = 1`

### Output

- `4`

### Explanation

The standard LIS is `[3, 4, 6]` (length 3).  
If we replace the `2` with `5`, we can obtain `[3, 4, 5, 6]` â€” strictly increasing, length 4.

## Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
- `0 <= k <= nums.length`
