# Approach:

* Use dynamic programming to solve the problem. Create a 2D DP table to store the results of subproblems.
* Initialize the DP table with the base cases where there are no more piles to choose from.
* Iterate from the end of the piles array towards the beginning, considering different maximum numbers of stones the current player can take.
* For each position and maximum number of stones, calculate the maximum score the current player can achieve by trying all possible moves and considering the opponent's score.
* Use the suffix sums of the remaining piles to optimize the calculations.
* Return the maximum score the first player can achieve starting from the first index with a maximum of 1 stone to take.

# Intuition:

* The problem involves two players taking turns and making optimal moves to maximize their scores.
* The DP table helps us keep track of the maximum score the current player can achieve from a certain position with a certain maximum number of stones to take.
* By iterating from the end of the piles array, we can build up the DP table based on the results of subproblems, starting with the base cases where there are no more piles to choose from.
* The optimal strategy is to consider all possible moves and calculate the score based on the opponent's score in subsequent positions.
* The suffix sums help us calculate the remaining sum of the piles efficiently, reducing the time complexity of the solution.
* Ultimately, the solution returns the maximum score the first player can achieve starting from the first index with a maximum of 1 stone to take.
