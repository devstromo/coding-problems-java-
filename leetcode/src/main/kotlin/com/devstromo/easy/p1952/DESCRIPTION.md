# 1952. Three Divisors

Given an integer n, return true if n has exactly three positive divisors. Otherwise, return false.

An integer m is a divisor of n if there exists an integer k such that n = k * m.


Example 1:

Input: n = 2

Output: false

Explanation: 2 has only two divisors: 1 and 2.

Example 2:

Input: n = 4

Output: true

Explanation: 4 has three divisors: 1, 2, and 4.



Constraints:

* 1 <= n <= 10<sup>4</sup>
